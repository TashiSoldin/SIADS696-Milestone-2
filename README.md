# SIADS 696 Milestone 2: Ocean Health Monitoring Using NOAA WOD

A comprehensive machine learning project analyzing ocean health using the NOAA World Ocean Database (WOD). This project applies supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to explore oceanographic patterns, predict dissolved oxygen levels, and uncover hidden structures in ocean data.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes the NOAA World Ocean Database to:
- Apply supervised learning methods to predict ocean oxygen levels and understand key environmental drivers
- Explore oceanographic patterns and relationships through dimensionality reduction and clustering
- Analyze the complex interactions between temperature, salinity, depth, and other ocean variables
- Provide insights into ocean health indicators and environmental patterns across different regions and time periods

### How to Obtain the Data

The World Ocean Database is available for public use without restriction. Follow these steps to download the data:

1. **Navigate to WODselect**: Visit [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/world-ocean-database-select/dbsearch.html](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/world-ocean-database-select/dbsearch.html)

2. **Select Criteria**:
   - **Observation Dates**: Choose your date range (e.g., 2000-2018)
   - **Dataset**: Select **Ocean Station Data (OSD)** only
   - **Measured Variables**: 
     - Select variables needed (Temperature, Salinity, Oxygen, etc.)
     - The first checkbox includes the variable if available
     - Leave unselected to include all OSD variables
   - **Optional Filters**: Depth range, country, geographic coordinates, etc.

3. **Generate Query**:
   - Click "Get an Inventory" to preview your selection
   - Review the dataset distribution map and cast count

4. **Download Data**:
   - Click "Download Data"
   - Select **CSV format (standard output)**
   - Choose **Observed level data** (depth measurements in meters)
   - Include **WOD flags** for quality control information
   - Select **No corrections**
   - Provide your email address
   - You'll receive download links via email when the query is complete

5. **Save Data**: 
   - Download the CSV file(s)
   - Place them in the `Data/` directory
   - The files are not tracked in git due to size

**Note**: Query processing time varies based on the amount and complexity of data requested.
